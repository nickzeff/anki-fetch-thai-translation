# Anki-Chinese-Dict-Autofill

A very simple add-on that will allow you to automatically fill in your Chinese Anki card definitions. Just make sure to set which field your word is in and which field you would like the English definition to go in the config file.

## Installation

To install, download this repository into the plugins folder. The folder can be found by going to Tools -> Add-ons -> View Files.

## Config

To configure settings, go to Tools -> Add-ons -> Select this add-on and click Config. It should look like this:
```
{
    "definition_field": "Definition", 
    "word_field": "Target"
}
```
To generate the definitions, go to card explorer and select the cards that need the definitions filled in. Once selected, go to 'Edit', then 'Generate Chinese Definitions' in the top bar.
