# Anki-Chinese-Dict-Autofill

A very simple add-on that will allow you to automatically fill in your Chinese Anki card definitions. Just make sure to set which field your word is in and which field you would like the English definition to go in the config file (open up add-ons, select this add-on, click on config, and set the correct field names).

To generate the definitions, go to card explorer and select the cards that need the definitions filled in. Once selected, go to 'Edit', then 'Generate Chinese Definitions' in the top bar.
